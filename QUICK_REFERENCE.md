**Card Management:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Number already used"**
→ That number is already on your card. Try a different one.

**"B column must be 1-15"**
→ You're trying to put a number in the wrong column. Check the ranges at the top.

**"All cells must be filled"**
→ Some cells are still empty (showing "0"). Fill them or use Auto-Fill.

**Card looks cut off**
→ Shouldn't happen anymore! The card auto-scales to fit your screen.

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Create Multiple Cards**: More cards = more chances to win
2. **Mix Entry Methods**: Some auto, some manual for variety
3. **Watch the Analysis**: The app tells you exactly what you need
4. **Use Patterns Wisely**: Start with simpler patterns (Four Corners)
